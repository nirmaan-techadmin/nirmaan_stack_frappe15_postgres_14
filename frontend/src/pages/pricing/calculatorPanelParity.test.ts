/**
 * SLICE 12c-P (2026-10-06) -- CALCULATOR = RATE HELPER PANEL, ALWAYS. THE PERMANENT PROOF.
 *
 * Owner (standing, P1, verbatim): "we need to do comrpensive browser certs to verify if both calculator
 * and proicing helper giove same price for same inpiuts. they must always do so. any case of divergence
 * is failure. we need to check this for both ADP and Insyulation now and other categories as theyu get
 * buily in future."
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS DRIVES BOTH REAL PATHS AND NEVER ONE PATH TWICE. The `how` is documented at length on
 * `calculatorPanelParity.harness.ts`; in one line: the PANEL path computes through `compute(ctx)` with a
 * populated `extractionByRow` (the `ext` branch -- never-asked defaults, stored cells, the model's
 * items), the CALCULATOR path through `PricingCalculator`'s own construction (empty map,
 * `admitCalculatorOnly`) with the panel's final answers arriving as `overrides` (the branch where none of
 * that runs). Slice 12c found a wiring divergence between exactly those two branches -- a family written
 * to one key and read from another -- that no arithmetic test could see.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT IT COVERS, BY NAME (asserted, not described):
 *   - EVERY row of EVERY stored `BoQ Rate Suggestion Run`: 96 runs, 10,460 rows, over 15 categories
 *     across Electrical and HVAC. Rows are grouped into 4,695 DISTINCT INPUT CLASSES and one
 *     representative of each is computed -- `compute` is pure, so identical inputs give identical
 *     outputs on both paths and the class stands for its members exactly. The fixture carries every
 *     member's `run#row`, so the coverage claim is checkable from the file.
 *   - EVERY active SKU of every row-level category (1,929 cases incl. one all-blank refusal per
 *     category), and every family x unit class x ladder path of both item-list categories.
 *   - The resolution paths each sweep reached, named one by one.
 *
 * ⚠️ DIVERGENCES ARE LISTED, NOT TOLERATED. Owner item 7 (amended 2026-10-06): a divergence does not
 * stop the run; it is recorded in full and named in `calculatorPanelParity.awaiting.ts` as awaiting the
 * owner's ruling. These tests pass only if EXACTLY those differ -- a new one fails, and a listed one
 * that stops differing fails too, so nobody can quietly fix or mask one before the owner has ruled.
 *
 * NO PRODUCT FILE CHANGED IN THIS SLICE.

 *   R4        a cladding the family does not offer (foil on Acoustic, glass cloth on sheet insulation) is NOT a
 *             dropdown option on the calculator, so the pick is cleared under R1 and the row refuses with the
 *             "choose again" sentence where the panel refuses with the rule's own (12d-8, owner R4 option b).
 *   F_row_text_not_an_input   the calculator has no row text, so `named_in_row` / `refuse_on_unit_class.words`
 *             cannot fire there (12d-4a, accepted by owner).
 *   C_unit_not_offered   a BoQ row may arrive in a unit the family has NO rule for (the panel refuses "no SKU per
 *             sq.m ...") or one the picker hides (`units_not_offered`, owner S10) -- the calculator's picker offers only
 *             the classes the family prices in, so the two surfaces are fed different units BY DESIGN and the
 *             divergence is the unit class itself, never a figure computed from the same inputs.
 *
 * The covered set is pinned EQUAL to the set `itemListRuleOrder` generates (the same guard as
 * `ruleReachability.test.ts`), so a new rule with no parity case fails here too. A listed exclusion that
 * STOPS differing fails too -- a stale exclusion hides a rule that now reaches the calculator.
