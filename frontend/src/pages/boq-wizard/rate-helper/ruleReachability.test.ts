/**
 * SLICE 12d-8 / T1 + T3 (owner standing rules 1 and 3, approved 2026-10-08; built in 12d-7 Phase 1, made
 * permanent here) -- EVERY RULE FIRES FROM THE PANEL'S ENTRY POINT.
 *
 * 12d-6 found a rule (the double-layer reader) that worked in the inner pricer and in its tests and never
 * fired on the panel, because an EARLIER step on the path (option matching) rewrote the wording first. So:
 *
 *   T1  one named case per Derivation-tab rule of Insulation and ADP -- model-read, typed where a control
 *       exists, and its negative -- run through `makePricingSheetHelper(...).compute` on the LIVE asset
 *       (v33 at 12d-8; v36 since 12e-2, which adds the Piping rules P1-P5 -- read at runtime). PASS = the rule's OWN line / note / refusal appears AND the figure equals the
 *       pure pricer's over the same assembled inputs. EXCLUDED = an owner ruling forbids it on that path
 *       (T6 / U4 for a typed layered or slash thickness; R4 for a cladding the family does not offer).
 *
 *   THE GUARD: the set of rules this file names must EQUAL the set `itemListRuleOrder` generates from the
 *   config at runtime. A new rule with no case fails the suite; a case naming a rule that no longer exists
 *   fails it too. Two tab lines are declared NOT panel-path rules by name (the derived catalogue cells) and
 *   are checked to exist.
 *
 *   T3  the rewriter x rule matrix (12d-7 S4) kept as tests, with the 12d-7 findings F-1 / F-2 / F-3 as
 *       regression pins.
